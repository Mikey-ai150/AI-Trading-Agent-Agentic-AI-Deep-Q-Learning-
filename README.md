AI Trading Agent using Agentic AI & Deep Q-Learning
Developed an autonomous AI trading agent using Agentic AI and Deep Q-Learning to make data-driven trading decisions.

Trained the agent on historical market data to navigate market fluctuations and optimize trading strategies.

Implemented reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enable the agent to learn from rewards (profits/losses) and improve decision-making.

Achieved a positive profit in backtesting, demonstrating the agent’s ability to perform in dynamic market conditions.

Utilized Python with key libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas) for model development, training, and evaluation.

Integrated real-time (or simulated) market data feeds to test and refine the agent’s trading logic.

Applied risk management techniques to minimize losses and enhance profitability.

Demonstrated the potential of Agentic AI in automating financial decision-making processes.
